I would like to propose that we create a new release for download (called 2.1 beta ?).</p>\r\n<p>This will then make it more obvious to people discovering the project that things are now happening and also make it less likely that they download the (now quite old) 2.0.1.0 release and end up raises the same bugs that have been fixed.</p>\r\n<p>It also gives us an opportunity to get a wider variety of files tested in the field to make sure that the open office piece is working acceptably.</p>\r\n<p>Thoughts?</p>\r\n<p>Ian</p>\r\n",
