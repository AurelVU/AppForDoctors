If I open the file in Excel and re-save it, then it works fine.\r<br />\n<br />\nThe problem has already been reported here:\r<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://exceldatareader.codeplex.com/discussions/280390\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://exceldatareader.codeplex.com/discussions/280390</a>\r<br />\n<br />\n... however the person reporting it no longer required a fix, and the last post by Ian was that he needs a sample file to investigate this.\r<br />\n<br />\nI've uploaded a sample excel file here:\r<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.appointmentsms.com/test.xls\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.appointmentsms.com/test.xls</a>\r<br />\n<br />\nIt opens up fine in Excel, however if you read it with ExcelDataReader you will see that the last character in each cell is chopped off.  Then, if you open it in excel and re-save it, it works fine.\r<br />\n<br />\nIf you could take a look at this and fix or advise on a work around I would be very grateful :)\r<br />\n<br />\nCheers,\r<br />\nMichael<br />\n",
