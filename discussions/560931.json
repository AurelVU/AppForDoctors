Any help would be appreciated!\r<br />\n<br />\nI am reading an Excel spreadsheet that can contain wrongly formatted data, e.g. a cell could be formatted as a date but in Excel appears normally- as a string as it contains a string. When I read it with the Excel data reader it appears as 31/12/1899. How can I just get the value of the string as displayed in Excel? \r<br />\n<br />\nThanks!<br />\n",
