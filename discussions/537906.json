Where the data could continue for any number of records.\r<br />\n<br />\nIs this possible?  or is there anything that you can suggest?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks\r<br />\n<br />\nDarren<br />\n",

I modified the Excel Data Reader code to make it possible to:<br />\n<ul>\n<li>read a specific worksheet into a data table (instead of reading the entire workbook into a dataset and then retrieving the data table of interest)</li>\n<li>\nread a specific cell range from a specific worksheet into a data table<br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nI am about to contact the Ian1971 to see if it would be possible to integrate these changes into the Excel Data Reader.<br />\n",
