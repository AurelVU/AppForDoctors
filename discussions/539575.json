    "Html": "I have a .xlsx file where only some of the columns in row 1 has names. The columns with no name is automatically named 'Column?' (This is both Caption and ColumnName).\r<br />\nI have previously used Excel by opening as a database via oledb and where these columns were automatically named 'F?'. No I have a backward compatibility problem because of this.\r<br />\nThis is giving me problems as I do not feel I can just rename Column? to F? because I cannot seem to differentiate between a column actually named Column2 and one which was internally named Column2 because no name is specified in the spreadsheet.\r<br />\n<br />\nSo basically I have two questions;<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Is is possible to change the default behavior of this auto naming of columns with no name? Basically exchange 'Column' with 'F'</li>\n<li>\nOr is possible to tell if column didn't actually have a name (was blank). Then I can write the logic myself.<br />\n</li>\n</ol>\nThanks in advance :)<br />\n",
