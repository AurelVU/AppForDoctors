    "Html": "<p>I hear ya... I keep running into stumbling blocks as well, as I too am a newbie to using this project.</p>\n<p>What I meant was, in the project, web site, whatever you are working in where you wish to use the ExcelDataReader, follow my instructions in there. FYI, adding the library folder is simply something I like to do to keep seperate any dlls that aren't created by default when my working solution is created. You could skip that step and simply add reference to the Excel dll (and ICSharpCode&nbsp;may be&nbsp;needed as well,&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not sure) . So when you add the references, simply browse to the folder where you downloaded the dll(s) to.</p>\n<p>After I did all this myself, I kept getting an error when my web page was loaded... the error stated that it &quot;could not load assembly 'Excel, ...&quot; To resolve this I added a reference to the assembies section&nbsp;in the web.config file, and had to ensure the dlls were added to the GAC. That allowed to page to load. I am working in a SharePoint environment , so perhaps this will not happen to you.</p>\n<p>Currently, I am at a new stumbling block which is described here: <a href=\"http://exceldatareader.codeplex.com/discussions/346801\">http://exceldatareader.codeplex.com/discussions/346801</a></p>\n<p>Good luck</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
