When i read the 4th sheet (DataTable), it actually reads another sheet..\r<br />\n<br />\nFor eg:.\r<br />\n<br />\nI have sheets \r<br />\n1 Org Structure\r<br />\n2 Account Codes\r<br />\n3 Users\r<br />\n4 User Access\r<br />\n5 Financial Data\r<br />\n6 Budget Input Sheets\r<br />\n<br />\nI have all these sheets as a Datatable... Whne i refer Dataset.Tables[2], it actually takes data from sheet 6 Budget Input Sheets\r<br />\n<br />\nThe excel sheets were once moved back and forth...\r<br />\n<br />\nCould anyone sugges what might be the issue?\r<br />\n<br />\nRegards\r<br />\nRajeesh<br />\n",
