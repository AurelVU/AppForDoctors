    "Html": "I can't find examples, inline source documentation or other documentation about this project. What I've seen from the short introduction is that this library can read Excel files into DataSet-like table structures. This may work fine if the Excel worksheets are strict tables with only one header row containing the column names. But if the file contains arbitrary data with custom header rows, footer rows and other stuff, I need to access the cells directly and read the raw data from them. Can this library provide such methods? Like, say, access row 10, column 3, interpret as decimal number, or maybe even give me the raw string value (if that exists) for me to interpret it on my own as number, currency, date or something else.<br />\n",
