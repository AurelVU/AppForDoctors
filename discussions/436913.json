Because of the sizable changes to the framework between 1.1 and 2.0, I'm afraid that an upgrade may crash the existing project on there. Is there any way to get this library to work in .NET 1.1? I haven't tried it yet, so maybe it works as is, but I see that the specs say 2.0 or greater. Thanks. <br />\n<pre><code> Seth</code></pre>\n\n",

    "Html": "I've never compiled a binary from source, and I'm sure that I'd miss one swap to ArrayList that would bomb out the app, so I was leaning towards the hacky way to begin with. We'll probably only run this process a few times, so I'm cool with creating a csv as necessary. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the fact that our production web server is running .NET 1.1. I thought I'd give it a shot. Thanks for your help. \r<br />\nSeth<br />\n",
