There are a few reasons for this:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>It's quicker</li>\n<li>The UI is much better</li>\n<li>People can fork the project and contribute that way. It makes it easier for people to contribute, and that is a good thing.</li>\n<li>I'm pretty much the only active developer on this project at the moment and I really prefer git.</li>\n<li>\nI don't know who is actually the admin of the project any more.<br />\n</li>\n</ol>\nSo, I'd thought I'd put this up for discussion to see if anyone cared either way, or had a strong opinion about it.\r<br />\n<br />\nCheers\r<br />\nIan<br />\n",
