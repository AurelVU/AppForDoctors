But the 2nd row is r=2!\r<br />\n<br />\nClearly, this is a problem with SAP not ExcelDataReader.  But is it easily resolved in ExcelDataReader?\r<br />\n<br />\nExcelDataReader version 2.1.2.3, Net 2.0\r<br />\n<br />\nI can't post the whole sheet as it's client data, but here's the relevant part, with r=&quot;0&quot; not r=&quot;1&quot;:<br />\n<pre><code>  &lt;sheetData&gt;\n    &lt;row r=&quot;0&quot; spans=&quot;&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;c r=&quot;A1&quot; s=&quot;1&quot; t=&quot;s&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;v&gt;202&lt;/v&gt;\n      &lt;/c&gt;\n      &lt;c r=&quot;B1&quot; s=&quot;1&quot; t=&quot;s&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;v&gt;203&lt;/v&gt;\n      &lt;/c&gt;\n    &lt;/row&gt;\n    &lt;row r=&quot;2&quot; spans=&quot;1:12&quot;&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n",
