    "Description": "I get an error: \"Input string was not in a correct format.\" when Column A1 is empty in the excelReader.AsDataSet() method when opening an OpenXML file.  The same file works fine when data is present, also works fine when converted to XLS file.  Code below.  Sample file attached.\n \nIs there a work around or fix planned?\n \nThanks,\n-Rick\n \n \nVB.Net Code:\n                        Dim oFI As New FileInfo(FilePath)\n\t\t\tIf Not oFI.Exists Then Throw New Exception(\"Could not find uploaded file on the server.
