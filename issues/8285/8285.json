    "Description": "If I read the attached spreadsheet as a DataSet, the cell A1 is read as having a null value.  In fact, it has a text value of \"#REF!\".\nÂ \nNote that this is different to the issue where actual broken references were being treated as null.  I've submitted a patch to that problem as #8213.",
