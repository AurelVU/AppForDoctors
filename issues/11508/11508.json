    "Description": "Hi!\n\nCould you please add a dependency to the ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib library to the nuget package? Either include the file itself (using [files](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/reference/nuspec-reference#File_Element_Examples)) or add a NuGet package dependency (using [dependencies](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/reference/nuspec-reference#Specifying_Dependencies_in_version_2.0_and_above)). It is very inconvenient to having to include this myself and even if I do, it will complain the exact required version mismatches.",

      "Message": "It's no rocket science; I provided 2 links in the \"issue\" already to all the relevant information. My problem is the author hasn't checked in the .nuspec file which he/she used to create the NuGet package in the first place. \r\n\r\n__However__: the .nupkg file (the package that gets downloaded by NuGet) contains the original .nuspec file as well (just rename the .nupkg file to .zip and open the zipfile) to discover the original .nuspec file:\r\n\r\n```\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<package xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/packaging/2010/07/nuspec.xsd\">\n  <metadata>\n    <id>ExcelDataReader</id>\n    <version>2.1</version>\n    <authors>iciobanu</authors>\n    <owners>iciobanu</owners>\n    <projectUrl>http://exceldatareader.codeplex.com/</projectUrl>\n    <requireLicenseAcceptance>false</requireLicenseAcceptance>\n    <description>Lightweight and fast library written in C# for reading Microsoft Excel files ('97-2007).</description>\n    <tags>Excel</tags>\n  </metadata>\n</package>\n```\r\n\r\nThere's your content. Now go check out both links I've provided, edit the .nuspec file (don't forget to up the version!) and then execute a:\n```\nnuget.exe pack ExcelDataReader.nuspec\n```\nYou should have a new .nupkg file. [Upload it](https://www.nuget.org/packages/upload) to nuget.org and you're done.",
