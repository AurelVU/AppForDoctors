    "Description": "On initiliasation of the ExcelBinaryReader, a set of worksheet global information is retrieved (including the set of Sheet Names).\n\nHowever it is not possible to inspect the name of the first sheet without performing a read operation first.\n\nOn investigation this is related to the initialisation of the m_SheetIndex value which is initialied to -1 and not incremented until the first read.\n\nNote: It is possible to get the name of the first sheet without performing a read operation on the ExcelOpenXmlReader.\n\nA patch will soon be submitted in relation to this.",
