    "Description": "I have an issue reading a spreadsheet in when the header row has a trailing space on all the header column names.\n\nI can usually do this, row[\"ColumnName\"] but if when it has a trailing space, I can't event do this row[\"ColumnName \"] as I get the \"NotSupportedException\".\n\nMy only choice is to either remove the trailing space from the spreadsheet, or reference the column by index. I have also tried looping thru the columns to get their names and then try to access the data using these names, but I get the same exception.\n\nAnyone experience something similar or have a workaround other than changing the spreadsheet?",
