    "Description": "This may be a strange case... but:\n\nIf a string value is stored within a cell with Date formatting....  the string value can be read correctly but then later overwritten by an incorrect DateTime value...\n\nPlease refer to the attached spreadsheet, cell E8\n\nOn investigation this looks to be due to the use of \"if\" rather than \"else if\" within the ReadSheetRow method of the ExcelOpenXmlReader (between the string and string inline conditions)..\n\nA patch will be submitted shortly.",
