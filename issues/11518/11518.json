You can manually install SharpZipLib from NuGet, but it is currently 0.86.\r\n\r\nOne workaround is to add this to your app.config\n```\n      <dependentAssembly>\n        <assemblyIdentity name=\"ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib\" publicKeyToken=\"1b03e6acf1164f73\" culture=\"neutral\" />\n        <bindingRedirect oldVersion=\"0.0.0.0-0.86.0.518\" newVersion=\"0.86.0.518\" />\n      </dependentAssembly>\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut really the best fix is if ExcelDataReader can change to not need a specific SharpZip version, and also register the dependency in NuGet.",

The next step is to get the package declared abandoned and get someone else assigned as the owner.
