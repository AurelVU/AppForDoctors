    "Description": "Am I the only one experiencing this?  I can't believe that.\n\nI haven't seen any documentation on this issue.\nI'm using version 2.1.2.0. Everything else works fine.\n\nIf I do Save as from excel the number formats just fine.\n\nWhen doing excelDataReader.AsDataSet I get a scientific notation number.\nThis number 100025440003960000 becomes this - 1.00E+17.\n\nThis is a complete deal breaker for me.\nI like the library because it's fast and easy to use but if I can't resolve this I have to find another library to use.\n\nAny info would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks.",
