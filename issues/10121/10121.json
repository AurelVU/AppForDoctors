    "Description": "I'm dealing with BIFF8 documents generated by some proprietary accounting application (which is ubiqutous in Russia) and it seems in these documents the \"last existing row\" field from the \"worksheet index\" record is bogus and is less than the (correct) number available via the \"dimensions\" worksheet record.\n \nWhile this can be viewed as the mentioned program violating \"the specification\", native Microsoft software and OpenOffice/LibreOffice have no problem dealing with these files so I'm inclined to think we should use the max available row number from that \"dimensions\" sheet record if it's available.\n \nThe attached patch contains the proposed fix.",
