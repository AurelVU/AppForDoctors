    "Description": "Hi,\n\nFirst of all, I need to say that the ExcelDataReader is a very nice feature. I am already using it for a while now and it a pretty good way to read excel files without having MS-Office installed.\n\nUnfortunately, I encountered an issue with reading data in Excel files (using excelReader.AsDataSet()).\n\nCell valuas that rely on a formula are not updated. \n\nI.e. when I use a formula to manipulate a date. Lets say: =TODAY()-10 and I read it on the day that I opened and save the Excel file it is retrieved properly. \n\nBut when I read it the next day (or any day in the future) without touching the Excel-file, I recieve the outcome of the formula as when it was last saved.\n\nIs this familiar behaviour and is there a solution? It makes no sence to reopen and save the excel file each time prior to reading the data using the ExcelDataReader.\n\nDying for an answer here... \n\nKind regards",
