    "Description": "Hi there - excellent utility!  Following a discussion, would it be possible for a flag to be added e.g. PutFirstRowIntoHeader boolean, so that if the first row of an excel sheet are headers, these can be used?  I believe someone in the discussion has even provided code to amend the dataset to do this.\nKind Regards,  Mark",
