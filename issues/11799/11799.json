    "Description": "When I try to read a record from an Excel File with Read() method, a \"System.SystemException\" was unhandled Message=\"Data de OleAut inv√°lida.\" I think the cause of the exception there is a field in excel file which is a data type that is not recognized (Date and Time for example), because when I debug the program, I get all the records until the record that exists a Date or Hour field.\n\nPlease, I'll apreciate any help, thanks!",
