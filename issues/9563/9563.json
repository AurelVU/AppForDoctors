      "Message": "I am also running into this same error message loading an Excel file. Only it's an Excel '97 (.xls) file that was created in Excel 2007 (we're trying to integrate data from some older vendor systems, and unfortunately don't have the luxury of using xlsx files). Even with the IsFirstRowAsColumnNames attribute set to true it fails to load the column names, and instead assigns them as \"Column1\", \"Column2\", etc. But this is probably a symptom of the broader error that's occurring.\r\n\r\nFiles created in older version of Excel - or using a third party system (e.g. Crystal Reports) - load just fine. I've recreated the older files in Excel 2007 with the same data, formatting, layout, etc. It looks like there's a difference between the 2 files - the one created in Excel 2007 is missing some header info when I view the file in a plain text editor.\r\n",
