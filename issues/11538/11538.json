    "Description": "__Unit test following fix:__\n\nTrying to read a .xls file and I get this --> Error: Neither stream 'Workbook' nor 'Book' was found in file.\n\nStepping though the code while it was reading the file confirms the error message is technically right. There is a 'WORKBOOK' entry though.\n\nAt the bottom of the XlsRootDirectory.cs file, is a method FindEntry that does the finding. I just changed it to be case insensitive and it read the file ok.\n\nFrom this: \nif\n(e.EntryName == EntryName)\n\nTo this:\nif\n(string.Compare(e.EntryName,\n EntryName, true)\n == 0)",
