    "Description": "This may be similar to a recently reported issue. In the attached xlsx file when it is imported using ExcelReaderFactory.CreateOpenXmlReader(stream) if any cell is blank then the cell to the right of it loses its value (i.e. it is not imported correctly). Also there are wierd rounding errors on may of the cells (e.g. 32115.35 becomes 32115.34999999999999999).",

But reading H15 using the library I receive Null value.\r\nIf I add a value into H14 too, then I can read also \"pippo\" from H15!\r\n\r\nIf I save the file in xls format I don't have this problem.\r\nSomeone can help me?",
