    "Description": "Hi guys,\n\nwe're having an issue while reading our excel sheets. It seems that if a cell value references to another cell the value is always treated as a number.\n\nE.g. Having a text value of 0004 in A5.\nCell B1 (formated as text and displayed by excel as 0004) references to A5 by =$A$5\nThe value read by ExcelDataReader 2.1.2.0 and below treats it as 4.\n\nIf you need any further information just leave a comment here and I'll provide you those infos and support you as best as I can.\n\nThank you very much in advance.",
