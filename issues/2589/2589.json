    "Description": "Because of some Excel weirdness (Office 2003), some of my workbooks containing only data are being saved with the workbook in an uncalced state. While this, in my opinion, shouldn't be happening, I also believe that ExcelReader shouldn't punt and shut down if it encounters this flag. The biff recordtype for this is 0x005E which is not currently reflected in the enum BIFFRECORDTYPE. The ExcelReader object returns no DataTables in this case even though the workbook contains data. I have fixed my problem by forcing a recalc in Excel before saving the files but I would suggest that this is something that could be improved in this software.",
