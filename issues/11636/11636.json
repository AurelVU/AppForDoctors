It seems that SQL Reporting services creates some records that have invalid bounds. Excel itself opens them ok, so adding this option should make it work similarly.\n\nAlso I found the the implementation of LABEL was incorrect and was offset by one character. LABEL is not usually used in BIFF8 but it seems SQL reporting services does use it.",
