    "Description": "I tested this on ExcelDataReder of v2.1 using ExcelBinaryReader. I got autogenerated report which doesn't have correct LastColumn and LastRow set in its dimension (excel populates them correctly but external tools might not do this). Therefore last few records are not read from such file and exception is raised because index of column accessed is greater than total number of columns specified in the file's dimension.",
