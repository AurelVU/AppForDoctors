    "Description": "Hello,\n\nWhen I use ExcelReaderFactory.CreateOpenXmlReader() the date fields come as DateTime type and when I use CreateBinaryReader() the date fields come as Int type (OADate).\n\nI've tried using the overloaded AsDataReader(bool convertToOADate) passing true and false, but nothing changed.\n\nI'm using the following code:\n```\n        DataSet result;\n        IExcelDataReader excelReader;\n        public void ReadExcel(string filename, Stream stream)\n        {\n            string extension = Path.GetExtension(filename);\n            \n            if (extension.ToLower().Contains(\"xlsx\"))\n            {\n                excelReader = ExcelReaderFactory.CreateOpenXmlReader(stream);\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                excelReader = ExcelReaderFactory.CreateBinaryReader(stream);\n            }\n\n            excelReader.IsFirstRowAsColumnNames = true;\n            result = excelReader.AsDataSet();\n\n            excelReader.Close();\n        }\n```\n\nIs there a way to load data in OADate format when using OpenXml format?",

      "Message": "The parameter is actually convertOADate and what it does is convert an OADate in an excel binary format to a datetime.\r\n\r\nOADate does not apply to OpenXml dates as far as I know. The date is held in the xml as a date string not an OADate.\r\n\r\nIf you wanted to convert a DateTime to an OADate you would have to do that yourself.",

I just don't know how to convert it, because I don't know what format will be used (for example: in brazil date format is dd/mm/yyyy)\n",
