    "Description": "Due to some problems resolving SharpZipLib on my project's Test and Stage environments, I've found that ExcelDataReader has been built against a different version to what the NuGet package states.\n\nNuGet states 0.86 is required but when my code that references Excel.dll runs, it says it can't resolve 0.85. Looking at the source, both Excel.4.0.csproj and Excel.4.5.csproj reference 0.85 but Excel.csproj references 0.86.\n\nI've tried to use binding redirects but can't get them to reliably work.\n\nWhich is incorrect - the NuGet package or the references? If you are looking to standardize on a particular version across projects perhaps consider the [SharpZipLib NuGet package](http://www.nuget.org/packages/SharpZipLib). It may help alleviate this problem in the future.",
